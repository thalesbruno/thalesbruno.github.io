      <description>Numerical variables, also known as quantitative variables, are the type of data that represent something measurable or countable like frequency, measurement, etc. Another attribute of numerical variables is that they are always numbers that can be placed in a meaningful order with consistent intervals.

      <description>A categorical variable (sometimes called a nominal variable) is a variable that can assume one of a limited number of possible values described as categories and there is no intrinsic ordering to the categories. It uses labels, names, or other descriptors (even numbers) to identify exclusive categories or types of things.
As an example of a categorical variable we may mention Nationality having values like Brazilian, Canadian, French, etc., and we can see that there is no ordering between the values: we cannot say that Brazilian is higher than Canadian.</description>
