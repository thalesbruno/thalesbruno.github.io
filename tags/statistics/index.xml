      <description>In this article, we are talking about the common methods to measure the central tendency of the data, that is a way to explain our data in some manner. Although these measurements are quite simple, they are a foundation for a lot of other more complex measurements.
We will use this fake list of grades of a class below to demonstrate the concepts:
   Grades     9.</description>

      <description>Despite the clickbait title, this is not an article to be polemic or say universal truths, but just an invitation to think about it.
A pie chart, sometimes called a pizza chart, is a chart in a format that seems like a - guess what? - pie, i.e., a round shape divided into slices. According to this article:
 A pie chart is a circular graph that shows the relative contribution that different categories contribute to an overall total.</description>

      <description>Numerical variables, also known as quantitative variables, are the type of data that represent something measurable or countable like frequency, measurement, etc. Another attribute of numerical variables is that they are always numbers that can be placed in a meaningful order with consistent intervals.
As examples of quantitative variables we may mention:
 Weight Height Sales Production units Movie Ratings  Discrete and continuous Numerical variables may be either discrete or continuous.</description>

      <title>Categorical Variables</title>

      <description>A categorical variable (sometimes called a nominal variable) is a variable that can assume one of a limited number of possible values described as categories and there is no intrinsic ordering to the categories. It uses labels, names, or other descriptors (even numbers) to identify exclusive categories or types of things.
As an example of a categorical variable we may mention Nationality having values like Brazilian, Canadian, French, etc., and we can see that there is no ordering between the values: we cannot say that Brazilian is higher than Canadian.</description>
