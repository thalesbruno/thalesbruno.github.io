      <description>The last week wasn&amp;rsquo;t the most productive week in my life for sure&amp;hellip; I have come back to work after a quite short 10-day vacation and I think that my anxiety about the return pushed me down.
Entertainment Not much entertainment last week for me, but I watched English Football on most days. Since the return of the Football in England after the Pandemic outbreak, there are matches almost every single day.</description>

      <description>I have decided to begin this weeknotes series here in my blog to keep me writing. As I say in the About section, I am trying to change my career, and this is such a really big project that will affect all my life and even the life of people around me. So I am dedicating time and energy to make this possible, and it will.
English Last week was one more week of English learning and English improvement as well.</description>
