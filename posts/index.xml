			<description>In this article, we are talking about the common methods to measure the central tendency of the data, that is a way to explain our data in some manner. Although these measurements are quite simple, they are a foundation for a lot of other more complex measurements.
We will use this fake list of grades of a class below to demonstrate the concepts:

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this article, we are talking about the common methods to <strong>measure the central tendency of the data</strong>, that is a way to explain our data in some manner. Although these measurements are quite simple, they are a foundation for a lot of other more complex measurements.</p>
<p>We will use this fake list of grades of a class below to demonstrate the concepts:</p>
<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Grades</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>9.2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7.5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td>9</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td>8.5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td>8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td>2.5</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We create a Python variable to store the grades:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="n">grades</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mf">9.2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">7.5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">8.5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">2.5</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="mean">Mean</h2>
<p>The first one is the <strong>mean</strong>, which is the arithmetic average of the data. To calculate the mean of a set of numeric data, we take the sum of all observations divided by the number of observations.</p>
<p>In Python:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">typing</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">List</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">mean</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So, applying in our grades data: <code>mean(grades)</code> gives us <code>~7.52</code>.</p>
<h2 id="median">Median</h2>
<p>The second one is the <strong>median</strong>, which gives us something more <em>positional</em>. The median is the exact central value of a data, so to calculate it we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sort data from smaller to largest, and</li>
<li>If ODD length: pick up the middle value</li>
<li>If EVEN length: calculate the mean of the two middle values</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in Python could be like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">median</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">sorted</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="c1"># If odd lenght, just pick up the middle value</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="mi">2</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="c1"># If even lenght, take the mean of the left and right middle values</span>
  <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">l_p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">//</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="n">r_p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">//</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
    <span class="n">mid_values</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">l_p</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">r_p</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">mean</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mid_values</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This way, the grades sorted looks like this: <code>[2.5, 7.5, 8, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.2]</code> and their median, <code>median(grades)</code>, is <code>8</code>.</p>
<h2 id="mode">Mode</h2>
<p>Finally, we have the <strong>mode</strong>, i.e., the observation that occurs the most in a dataset. Thus, a dataset may have <em>one</em>, <em>multiple</em>, or even <em>none</em> mode.</p>
<p>Python mode function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">collections</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Counter</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">mode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">]:</span>
  <span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Counter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x_i</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x_i</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">count</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">counter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">items</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="nb">max</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">counter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">values</span><span class="p">())]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The grade that occurs the most in our dataset is <code>[8]</code> as we can see calling <code>mode(grades)</code></p>
<h2 id="python-mean-median-and-mode">Python mean, median, and mode</h2>
<p>In this article, we made some Python code to illustrate our measurements, just as didactic purposes. By the way, we already have functions in Python libraries that make the job. Bellow, some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mean: <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html">numpy.mean</a></li>
<li>Median: <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.median.html?highlight=median#numpy.median">numpy.median</a></li>
<li>Mode: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/statistics.html#statistics.mode">statistics.mode</a></li>

			<description>I have decided to begin this weeknotes series here in my blog to keep me writing. As I say in the About section, I am trying to change my career, and this is such a really big project that will affect all my life and even the life of people around me. So I am dedicating time and energy to make this possible, and it will.
English
Last week was one more week of English learning and English improvement as well.</description>

As I say in the About section, I am trying to change my career, and this is such a really big project that will affect all my life and even the life of people around me. So I am dedicating time and energy to make this possible, and it will.</p>
<p><strong>English</strong><br>
Last week was one more week of English learning and English improvement as well. I think I am doing this very well since I am not spending any money on courses, lessons, or minutes of conversation with natives. My learning routine includes YouTube lessons, Movies and TV Series with English audio and subtitles, English TV Channels, and all Data Science content I am stuying in English.</p>
<p><strong>Entertainment</strong><br>
I watched a few things last week as usual. Interstellar was the most significant for sure! I fell in love with the Sci-Fi genre since I watched Dark, and Interstellar already became one of my favorite films ever. I just finished a short film on YouTube right now called Voskhod, the same genre, pretty good, and what is better: it&rsquo;s from a sci-fi brand called DUST, and there is a lot of content in their YouTube Channel. So I think I will talk about them in every weeknote for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Machine Learning</strong><br>
Finally, I have done my fourth course at Kaggle: Intermediary Machine Learning. I am quite excited about this stuff and now I am going to begin with the competitions. At the same time, I am studying Statistics on this amazing YouTube Playlist.</p>
<p>Enough weeknote for now. Next week I am going to be back.</p>

			<description>Despite the clickbait title, this is not an article to be polemic or say universal truths, but just an invitation to think about it.
A pie chart, sometimes called a pizza chart, is a chart in a format that seems like a - guess what? - pie, i.e., a round shape divided into slices. According to this article:
 A pie chart is a circular graph that shows the relative contribution that different categories contribute to an overall total.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Despite the clickbait title, this is not an article to be polemic or say universal truths, but just an invitation to think about it.</p>
<p>A pie chart, sometimes called a pizza chart, is a chart in a format that seems like a - guess what? - pie, i.e., a round shape divided into slices. According to this <a href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/ld/all-resources/numerical-data/pie-charts">article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A pie chart is a circular graph that shows the relative contribution that different categories contribute to an overall total.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, each piece of the chart has its width defined for its proportional value into an overall total.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at an example.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/pie-charts-simple.png"
         alt="Simple pie chart"/> 
</figure>

<p>We see it&rsquo;s not a bad look chart for sure. Actually, it could be a pretty evident option if we have some category variable to analyze and plot. But the point <a href="https://verstaresearch.com/blog/why-you-should-avoid-pie-charts/">many people say</a> about avoiding them is because pie charts may don&rsquo;t do a good job showing the proportions of the parts vs. the whole or even if a piece is greater or less than the others if they have the same size, etc.</p>
<p>When the number of categories increases the problem seems clear:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/pie-charts-complex.png"
         alt="Pie chart with many categories"/> 
</figure>

<p>A bar chart plotting the same data:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/pie-charts-bar.png"
         alt="Bar plot"/> 
</figure>

<p>Then, as we may see, pie charts are a bit controversial and should be avoided in most cases. Tough with a few categories, maybe only two, they could not be a terrible choice as well. What do you think?</p>

			<description>Numerical variables, also known as quantitative variables, are the type of data that represent something measurable or countable like frequency, measurement, etc. Another attribute of numerical variables is that they are always numbers that can be placed in a meaningful order with consistent intervals.
As examples of quantitative variables we may mention:
 Weight Height Sales Production units Movie Ratings  Discrete and continuous Numerical variables may be either discrete or continuous.</description>

<li>Sales</li>
<li>Production units</li>
<li>Movie Ratings</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="discrete-and-continuous">Discrete and continuous</h2>
<p>Numerical variables may be either discrete or continuous.</p>
<p>Discrete values are the result of counting, like when we count how many goals a football team has scored in a season. Here, the data take certain numerical values, like 60, 65, 72, and so on.</p>
<p>On the other hand, continuous values are the result of a measurement. For instance, we may measure the weights in kilograms of football team players, and the data will assume continuous values inside a range, like 84.1kg, 74.89483kg.</p>
<h2 id="buckets-and-bins">Buckets and bins</h2>
<p>Buckets and bins are the way we may organize the numerical data collected in a meaningful order with consistent intervals to analyze and make insights from them. For example, we might collect the number of movies produced in the 20th Century and put them in buckets of 10 years, and as result, we could see the evolution of the Movie Industry in the last century.</p>
<p>But in this article, we will demonstrate a bit of numerical data using the Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps">Google Play Store Apps</a> dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/lava18">Lavanya Gupta</a> as we did in the article about <a href="https://thalesbr.uno/posts/categorical-variables/">Categorical Variables</a>.</p>
<p>Using pandas, we will load the dataset, but only the Rating column, which is a typical numerical variable. The users rated the Apps from 1.0 to 5.0.</p>

<h2 id="histogram">Histogram</h2>
<p>The chart we see above is a Histogram, which seems like the Bar Chart we&rsquo;ve plotted in the Categorical Variable post, but actually they have some important differences. In a Histogram there is no space between the bars, and the intervals are equally spaced, as expected to numerical values.</p>
<p>The shape of the histogram already gives us useful information. The histogram above is left-skewed (it has a tail to the left), so we may conclude that most Apps were well evaluated because the highest rectangles are on the right side of the histogram, where we have the highest rates (between 4.0 and 5.0).</p>
<p>Other shapes a histogram can have are right skew, symmetric, bimodal, uniform. Perhaps we will see more examples of histogram shapes in the next posts!</p>

			<description>A categorical variable (sometimes called a nominal variable) is a variable that can assume one of a limited number of possible values described as categories and there is no intrinsic ordering to the categories. It uses labels, names, or other descriptors (even numbers) to identify exclusive categories or types of things.
As an example of a categorical variable we may mention Nationality having values like Brazilian, Canadian, French, etc., and we can see that there is no ordering between the values: we cannot say that Brazilian is higher than Canadian.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A categorical variable (sometimes called a nominal variable) is a variable that can assume one of a limited number of possible values described as categories and there is no intrinsic ordering to the categories. It uses labels, names, or other descriptors (even numbers) to identify <em>exclusive</em> categories or types of things.</p>
<p>As an example of a categorical variable we may mention <strong>Nationality</strong> having values like <em>Brazilian, Canadian, French, etc.</em>, and we can see that there is no ordering between the values: we cannot say that Brazilian is higher than Canadian. In summary, there is no way to order these categories from highest to lowest or from best to worst.</p>
<p>Other examples of categorical variables could be <strong>Regions</strong> (<em>North, South, East, West</em>), <strong>Blood Type</strong> (<em>A, B, AB, O</em>) or <strong>Smartphone Brand</strong> (<em>Apple, Samsumg, LG, Xiami</em>).</p>
<p>However, if there is a clear order between the categories, so we are dealing with an ordinal variable, that is very similar to a categorical variable and often it&rsquo;s considered a special kind of this and placed on between categorical and quantitative variables. An example of an ordinal variable could be Educational Level (<em>Elementary school education, High school graduate, Some college, College graduate, Graduate degree</em>).</p>
<p>But in this article we are focusing on pure categorical or nominal variables, so let&rsquo;s check out what we can do with some categorical data.</p>
<h2 id="frequency-distribution">Frequency distribution</h2>
<p>Since we have a dataset with some categorical variables, the most common thing we can do is count the occurences of each category in the whole data. This will give us a frequency distribution.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some real data to demonstrate a frequency distribution. We will use the Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps">Google Play Store Apps</a> dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/lava18">Lavanya Gupta</a>. This dataset has more than 10,000 rows, each of them is an app from Google Play Store, and as features (columns) we can see the App name, Category, Rating, and others.</p>
<p>We will use pandas for handling the data. Firstly, we import pandas and read the CSV file downloaded from Kaggle, but only the <em>Category</em> column. Then, we use the <code>unique</code> method to show all values observed in our data. As we can see, there are 34 App Categories in our categorical variable, like <em>Finance, Sports, Weathers</em> and others and we can&rsquo;t see any order between them (<em>Events</em> category is not better or higher than <em>Shopping</em> category, for instance).</p>

<p>Now that we know all category values we can have, let&rsquo;s count how many times every category occurs in our data using <code>value_counts</code> method.</p>

<p>So, we can see above that most apps are from the <em>Family</em> category with 1,972 occurrences. <em>Game</em> and <em>Tools</em> are also common categories, on the other hand, there are few apps from the <em>Beauty</em> category.</p>
<h2 id="relative-frequency">Relative Frequency</h2>
<p>At the moment we already know how many apps we have from each category. But what if we wanted to figure out what is the percentage of Medical apps of all apps? Then we need to calculate the relative frequency of category apps dividing the frequency by the total number of apps (aka the sample data).</p>
<p>Relative frequency of something = Frequency of something / n</p>
<p>Again, we will use the marvelous pandas. The relative frequency must assume a value from 0 to 1, but here we will multiply it by 100 and show the values in percentage form instead. So, as you can see below, Medical apps represent approximately 4.27% of all apps in Google Play Store according to our dataset.</p>

<p>Finally, we will plot the frequency variable in a Bar Chart that is a pretty common way to visualize categorical data.</p>

<p>So, in this article we have seen a bit about Categorical Variables or Nominal Variables, which is a pretty usual data type we face in Statistics, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and so on. It was just an introductory content, but we may cover it a little deeper in upcoming posts.</p>
